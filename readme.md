## Learning Happstack

I met [Happstack](http://www.happstack.com) thanks to [Suave](http://suave.io/). Recently I read the [Tamizh](https://twitter.com/tamizhvendan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)'s book, [F# Applied](http://products.tamizhvendan.in/fsharp-applied/). I really loved the way how Tamizh starts the introduction to Suave building a "Mini Suave", that is, a console application is used to explain the `WebParts` and `combinators`. 

Now that I'm reading [The Happstack Book](http://www.happstack.com/docs/crashcourse/index.html) I realized the common things between Happstack and Suave. So I decided to translate the examples used in the F# Book to Haskell, just for fun and learning purposes
